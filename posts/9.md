<br />

I'm proud to announce the launch of [Your Daily Len](http://xoxodan.com/dailyLen). 

<br />
Studies have shown that *Steal My Sunshine* is a lighthearted and carefree tune. Although these studies may not reflect lyrical content (due to the lyrics being mostly incomprehesible and nonsensical), the fact remains that hearing the beat kick in will instantly transport the listener to a world where the sky is always a clear blue, the mopeds never run out of gas, and joy is expressed through a series of impromptu kung fu moves. 

<br />
So, what better way to start your day than with a quick viewing of this fantastic music video? Sign up for [Your Daily Len](http://xoxodan.com/dailyLen) to get a link to the video emailed to you every single morning. No frills, no hidden fees, no contracts to sign. Donations acccepted. 

<br />
Your Daily Len, Inc. is currently accepting offers from VCs. Serious inquiries only, please.
