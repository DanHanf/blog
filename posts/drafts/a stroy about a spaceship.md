A STORY ABOUT A SPACESHIP

"Adjust the port StarFlap!" shouted Captain Denny Pushgil. 

_He's always shouting these days,_ thought Ship Councellor Lex. She made a mental note to give him some brochures about lowering day-to-day stress levels. _If the idiot gets us out of Zaandak "No Mercy For Humans" Bloodbot's torture galaxy alive, that is._

"Port StarFlap is not responding," said Navigator Geoff. 

_Hmm. Geoff seems unusually calm, considering the situation,_ Lex thought. She made another mental note, this time about some brochures on reacting appropriately to life-threatening circumstances. Geoff could stand to learn something about that.

The Captain shot his gaze to Branton Feelix, the ship's Engineering Liason. Branton wasn't good enough at engineering to be an engineer, but he was good enough at relaying messages to be a liason. "Reroute all power from interdeck entropy systems to StarFlap autorepair bot!" Captain Pushgil shouted. 

Branton nodded and relayed the message into his headset mic. Then he nodded again and reported back to the Captain.

"Zaandak Bloodbot has boarded our ship and is currently slaughtering our engineering team." For the first time in his life, he was relieved to not be very good at engineering. 

Captain Pushgil screamed an explitive so loud it would have reached the center of the torture galaxy, if only famed Earth eccentric Talman Krigmon had lived long enough to fulfill his lifelong dream of filling space with air.

"Captain," said Navigator Geoff, "I have an idea."

_Weirdo,_ Lex thought.

"I'm all ears!" Pushgil shouted. A small amount of blood flew out of his mouth. His throat and vocal cords were all torn up, on account of all the shouting.
