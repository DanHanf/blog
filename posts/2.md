INTRODUCING CHS-TONIGHT
===

Hey, [chs-tonight](http://chs-tonight.com) just launched! This is a project I've been working on for a few weeks now and I'm really happy with the results so far. There's still a good bit to do, but it's functional and stylish and hopefully helpful. If even just one person goes to a cool show and gets a nice buzz going because of this website, it will all be worth it. 

In the coming days, I'll have a few posts detailing the process of creating chs-tonight. For now, I'm just happy to see the fruits of my labor on this ol' house we love called the information superhighway. 

You coder types can check out the [source code](https://github.com/DanHanf/chs-source) and barrage me with better ways I could have done everything. 

That's all for now.
