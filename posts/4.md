TWITTER? I HARDLY EVEN KNOW HER
===

I've said before that you should get in touch with me for various reasons. I'm *assuming* that the reason no one has is because I forgot to put my twitter handle anywhere on this site. It's up there now, near the top and down at the bottom.

Also, I said yesterday that no one has specifically told me they've used [chs-tonight](http://chs-tonight.com) yet. A scant few hours after I posted that, someone texted me saying they showed chs-tonight to some other people who then made plans to go to [Theatre 99](http://www.theatre99.com) tonight. That's reason enough for me to have a beer. Then again, just waking up is reason enough for me to have a beer.
