On Recognizing That One Is An Active Contributor To Gentrification And Pondering How Not To Do That Anymore
---

I recently relocated to the Wagener Terrace neighborhood of Charleston. Earlier in my career of finding affordable housing, I lived on Bee St. Earlier still, Columbus St., and Race St. before that. A sly reader, familiar with the Charleston cityscape, will notice, as I recently did, that I'm effectively an active contributor to the aggressive and relentless push to gentrify the peninsula. 

It's a troubling realization, and I imagine that the way I feel about the doctor's kids and lawyer's kids and Ex-NFL player's kids who's parents are ready and willing to pay 1000+ bones a month for their little kiddies to live in these fresh-coat-of-paint shitholes, ignoring the pleas of those of us who have had to work a little harder to survive, outpricing us and and pushing us further and further away from the heart of downtown Charleston...I can't help but think that's exactly how the family who used to live in this little Wagener Terrace duplex feel about me. And I can't even defend myself, because there's no use. I stole the home away from someone who simply couldn't afford to stay. I'm a declaration of manifest destiny and one AVICCI Spotify playlist away from being one of those dumb fuckers. And I didn't even grow up with the perks of having a doctor for a dad.

So, the question is this: What can a person who is gentrifying-through-being-gentrified do?
It's not like it's breaking news that the rich are running rampant or that they don't care about the poor. Paraphrasing Jon Stewart, the very fact that someone lands in a safety net is evidence that something has gone horribly wrong. But the middle class, God bless us, are both victims of the rich and villains of the poor, and that's a tough predicament. 

White guilt is almost more worthless than ignorance, because I feel guilty but I'm not fucking doing anything about it. It's the grunge movement of the 2010's--a bleak paralysis, caught between the seeming hopelessness of activism and the disenfranchised freeze of philanthropy.

Or maybe I'm an idiot? Am I blinded by my own desire to just live in a room I can afford in a place I want to live?
It comes down to this: I'm a contributing force to a movement I have absolutely no interest in contibuting to, but I don't know how to stop. There's probably an obvious solution, but I haven't though of it yet.

One last thought: The aforementioned house on Columbus St. was falling apart bit by bit, but it was nice enough, and cheap enough, and had a living room big enough to throw a few parties. There was a little old black lady who lived next door. We sat on our respective porches every once in a while and talked. I was always nice to her, and she was always nice to me. She told me stories about growing up on Columbus St., in that same house, experiencing the Civil Rights movement and the aftermath, raising a family of her own, and pushing onward into the 21st Century. A few years later, I found out one way or another that she had died. And she never told me this story, but I can't help thinking about the one where, after a long, full, life of struggle and defeat and triumph, she sat on her porch and watched her neighborhood be slowly dismantled, brick, by brick, by the same kind of people who claimed that the ballot she dropped in the box had any real meaning.
