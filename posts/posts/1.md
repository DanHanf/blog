Hi. Welcome to Dan.

I made this blog for a few reasons. One, I wanted to have a personal programming project and a blog is like the 'Hello World' of personal programming projects. The other 'Hello World' of personal programming projects is a game, which I'm also going to do. I want to present myself to the world with a strong, resounding 'HELLO.' I want to the world to turn its head and notice me.

You can read more (not much more though) about that stuff in the Tech area.

Ever since I was a wee child I'm thought of myself as a writer. I love writing and I feel like I'm able to express myself in a clearer, more digestible way with the written word. 

Digestion is important when communicating ideas, because once something is done being digested, it gets shit out. Ideas and thoughts were meant to be digested and shit out, because that's how ideas and thoughts get mutated, added to, sliced apart, rephrased, and passed around from brain to brain and eventually, usually if cats are involved, they enter the public conciousness. It's problematic for every thought and idea you have to be shared and digested and etc. etc. etc. but it's important for that to happen sometimes. 

But yeah, I enjoy speaking but I love writing. The problem is that, traditionally, I don't write without an explicit reason to. So here we are.

This section is gonna be for everything that's not tech or improv related.

Goodbye.
