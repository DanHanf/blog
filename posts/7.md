Charleston had a disastrous flood, which I don't have any photos of. Honestly, we had it much better here than almost everywhere else in SC. Jessika and I went to Hampton Park after the rain stopped, though, and messed with the panorama camera thing that is kind of new to me because I had an old iPhone for longer than I probably should have. Has anyone actually used the panorama camera on an iPhone to successfully take a non-glitchy panoramic picture? I'll leave that question to the philosophers.

I was lucky enough to work on a short film with some friends of mine! It's a great script & we had access to top-of-the-line equipment. I can't waiiiiit to see it in its full form. That might be a little while, though, since we're not 100% finished filming it...but that's okay. It's been so much fun to be a part of, and I'm so excited for people to see it.
