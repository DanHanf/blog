Why Write About Improv
---

Short answer is because I love it, and when you love something, you want to talk about it.

A lot of the improvisors I respect have blogs where they talk about improv. In the same vein of dressing for the job you want, I'll blog like the improvisors I want to be. 

You will already know this, but I'll throw it out there anyway: My experience pales in comparison to these people. They are weathered geniuses, dispelling wisdom and truth at too-far intervals. I'll link to them occaisionally.

But I also think there's something to be said for a relative beginner's perspective on things, and I don't expect there to be many declaritive statements in these posts.
